# Calenro

Calenro is an app designed to help people who forget to check their calendar at the start of the day. Users of the app will receive a daily notification (at a configurable time) containing their schedule for the day. They can also enable notifications at the start of an event, as well as a permanent silent notification with their schedule for the day and next day.
